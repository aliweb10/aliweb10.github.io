            <p>But in just <span class="highlight">two days</span>, we found ourselves whispering 'I love you,' a truth we both felt with every fiber of our being.</p>
            <p>So certain, so immediate. It was as if our souls had recognised each other from another lifetime. We knew, instantly, that we wanted to be together forever.</p>

            <p>
                My love, my princess, my little baby,<br>
                In the quiet of my life, you came -<br>
                Not as a whisper, but as a flood,<br>
                Pouring light into every shadow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two weeks, and yet I have lived<br>
                An entire lifetime in your gaze.<br>
                Two days was all it took to know<br>
                That my heart belonged to you,<br>
                And would never wander again.
            </p>
            <p>
                We spoke of waiting,<br>
                Of time and patience,<br>
                But love like ours refuses to be delayed.<br>
                Today felt like the only day,<br>
                The right day,<br>
                The beginning of forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are my dream girl,<br>
                The miracle I never dared to hope for,<br>
                The perfect girlfriend I prayed existed<br>
                Somewhere in this wide, uncertain world -<br>
                And yet, here you are,<br>
                With a smile that softens every wound<br>
                And love that pulls me back from the edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will always depend on you,<br>
                Not just to save me from the darkness,<br>
                But to drag me under again -<br>
                Deep into your love,<br>
                Where even the shadows feel warm,<br>
                Where even the pain feels lighter.
            </p>
            <p>
                My heart is yours in every way.<br>
                It will beat your name<br>
                In every moment, every lifetime.<br>
                You are the love of my life forever,<br>
                And from this day on,<br>
                We walk together -<br>
                Not toward forever,<br>
                But already within it.
